-In this project, we realized that the value we entered in the counter period worked with a certain ratio in the max-min range thanks to pwm, and we determined the unit range with the value we gave to the counter period.

-When we make the counter period 200 in the servo motor, it resets when the unit is 4, when it reaches 26 units, it has made its final progress and reaches 180 degrees.

-When the counter period is 400, it works between 8-52. Thus, we realized that the higher the counter period, the more inter-unit resolution we work with.
